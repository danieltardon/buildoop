	* Package for Kafka Producer Avro.

	This package is an example for inyect Avro files
	to Kafka using the "Avro Server Schema Repository" used by
	Camus kafka consummer. This version is downloaded
	from [1]. And is packaged from the release tag
	"release-0.8.1". The nomenclature version rationale is
	the following:

	The producer is linked with the Kafka version 0.8, and this
	version of producer is the "version 1". So the tag is named
	"release-0.8.1". The last number will change with new version
	of this producer, and the two first numbers only will be changed
	with the mayor version of Kafka.

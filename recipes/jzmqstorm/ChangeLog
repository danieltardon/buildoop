	* The package bigtop-tomcat was included because of distributions like
	CentOS 5.x didn't shipped with recent versions of Tomcat [1]. Due to
	Buildoop support >= CentOS 6.x and those versions are shipping Tomcat
	6, a more recent version of this Servlet Container and Webserver, this
	dependency of "in-house Tomcat package" was removed.

	Because Oozie, and others need system-wide Tomcat server, those
	packages need depends on the standard distribution Tomcat package. The
	problem here is when we install the standard package "yum install
	tomcat6" this installation is plenty of dependencies of other
	packages, and one of them is the OpenJDK dependency, we need to avoid
	this dependency, because we are only supporting Oracle Sun JDKs. At
	this point we need to include a "in-house Tomcat package" as Bigtop
	project does it.

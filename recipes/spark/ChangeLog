	* We've got a problem with Spark 0.9.0-incubating
	build (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-1479).
	The Jira issue talk about Cloudera version, however we have
	the same problem with a clear Apache Hadoop 2.2.0. 

	So it's time to go ahead with a more stable version:

	Spark 1.0.0 stable version.
